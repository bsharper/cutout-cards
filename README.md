# cutout-cards
Creates individual card images from Cards Against Humanity's Family Edition 

# Running 

1. Download CAH_FamilyEdition_PublicBeta_LargeCards.pdf from https://www.cardsagainsthumanityfamilyedition.com/
2. Run `npm start` or `yarn start`
3. Sit back and watch the magic happen. Or better yet, go on a walk while remaining properly socially distanced.

# Why?

I wanted to split the cards up to play around with them for personal use.
